Overview
=====

Global Register (GLB), a general global setting module for chips, mainly includes clock, reset, bus, memory, power, and GPIO management.

Functional Description
===========
Clock Management
-------------
It is mainly used to set the clocks of processors, buses, and peripherals, set the clock source and frequency division of the above modules, and achieve the clock gating of these modules, to save power for the system. For more details, see system clock sections.

Reset Management
-------------
It provides the separate reset function of each peripheral module and the chip reset function.

See :ref:`reset-management-label` for details.

Bus Management
-------------
It provides bus arbitration and bus error settings, so that users can set whether to interrupt and provide the error bus address information when a bus error occurs, facilitating program debugging by users.

Memory Management
-------------
It manages the size of each memory area:

- EM management: A part of space of WRAM serves as EM, 32 KB by default. This function can assign the space of a specified size to EM, while the remaining one serves as WRAM.

It provides power management of each memory module in the low-power mode of the chip system, including two setting modes:

- Retention mode: The data in the memory can be saved, but it cannot be read or written before exiting the low-power mode
- Sleep mode: This mode is only used to reduce system power consumption, because it will cause memory data to lose

LDO Management
-------------
It provides on-chip LDO management:

- LDO management: The output voltage of the on-chip LDO can be adjusted to reduce power consumption.
