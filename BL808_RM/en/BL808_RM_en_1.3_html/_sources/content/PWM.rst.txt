Functional Description
===========
Clock and Frequency Divider
-------------
There are three options for PWM counter clock sources, which can be set through the reg_clk_sel field in the pwm_mc0_config0 register, and the clock source configuration is shown in the following table.

    +-------------+------------------+
    | reg_clk_sel | PWM clock source |
    +=============+==================+
    |      0      |    xclk          |
    +-------------+------------------+
    |      1      |    bclk          |
    +-------------+------------------+
    |    others   |    f32k          |
    +-------------+------------------+

Each counter has its own 16-bit frequency divider, which can divide the selected clock through APB. The PWM counter will take the divided clock as the counting cycle unit, and add one every time a counting cycle ends.

Active Level
---------
Different application scenarios require different active level states, some being active at low level and others being active at high level. The active level of each PWM output can be set independently.

When the <pwm_chy_ppl> bit in the register pwm_mcx_config1 is set to 1, it means that the forward channel of channel y (y = 0, 1, 2, 3) of pwmx (x = 0, 1) is set to be active at high level. That is, when the PWM module outputs logical '1', its corresponding pin outputs high level, and when it outputs logical '0', that outputs low level. When <pwm_chy_ppl> is set to 0, it means that the same is set to be active at low level. That is, when the PWM module outputs logical '1', its corresponding pin outputs low level, and when it outputs logical '0', that outputs high level. The setting bit of the complementary channel is \<pwm_chy_npl\>, and its setting rule is the same as that of the forward channel.

Principle of Pulse Generation
-------------
When the <pwm_chy_pen> bit in the register pwm_mcx_config1 is set to 0, it means that the forward channel of channel y (y = 0, 1, 2, 3) of pwmx (x = 0, 1) is set to a determined logic state, and then the state is determined by the <pwm_chy_psi> bit. When <pwm_chy_psi> is 0, the corresponding forward channel pin outputs logical '0', and when the same is 1, that outputs logical '1'. The actual output level must be jointly determined with <pwm_chy_ppl>. The setting bit of the complementary channel is <pwm_chy_nen>, and its setting rule is the same as that of the forward channel.

When the <pwm_chy_pen> (<pwm_chy_nen>) bit in the register pwm_mcx_config1 is set to 1, the forward (complementary) channel output of channel y (y = 0, 1, 2, 3) of pwmx (x = 0, 1) is determined by comparing the internal counter with the two thresholds. If the counter value is between the two thresholds, the forward channel outputs logical '1', while the complementary one outputs logical '0'. If the counter value is beyond the two thresholds, the forward channel outputs logical '0', while the complementary one outputs logical '1'. The waveform is shown as follows.

Brake
-----
When the brake function is used and the brake signal is generated, the level of the PWM output will be changed to a preset state, which is determined by the <pwm_chy_pbs> and <pwm_chy_nbs> (y = 0, 1, 2, 3) bits in the register pwm_mcx_config1 (x = 0, 1). When the bits are set to 1, PWM outputs logical '1' after the brake signal is generated. When the same is set to 0, PWM outputs logical '0' after the brake signal is generated.

Brake signals include external brake and software brake. When the <pwm_sw_break_en> in pwm_mcx_config0 (x = 0, 1) is 1, the internal brake signal will be generated. When this bit is 0, the brake state will be exited and PWM will resume to its previous operation mode. When the <pwm_ext_break_en> bit is 1, the external brake function is enabled. If the external brake pin state matches the value set by <pwm_ext_break_pl>, a brake signal will be generated. If that state is opposite to the value set by <pwm_ext_break_pl>, PWM will exit the brake state. It should be noted that only PWM0 supports external brake, and PWM1 cannot do that.

If the brake interrupt is enabled, the interrupt will be triggered when the external brake signal is generated. Software brake will not trigger an interrupt.

Dead Zone
------
Different dead time can be set for each PWM channel independently. When the value of dead time is not 0, the forward channel of PWM will delay the generation of jump level when it matches the ThresholdL, and immediately change the level state when it matches the ThresholdH. The complementary channel of PWM will change the level state immediately when it matches the ThresholdL, and delay the generation of jump level when it matches the ThresholdH. The length of dead zone is set by the register pwm_mc0_dead_time, the deadband length is calculated as shown in the following table.

Cycle and Duty Ratio Calculation
-----------------
The PWM cycle is determined the clock division factor and the clock duration cycle. The clock division factor is set by the register PWMx_CLK_DIV\[15:0\](x: 0\~1) and is used to divide the source clock of PWM. The clock duration cycle is set by the register PWMx_PERIOD\[15:0\](x: 0\~1) and is used to set how many divided clock cycles a PWM cycle consists of. That is, PWM cycle = PWM source clock/PWMx_CLK_DIV\[15:0\]/PWMx_PERIOD\[15:0\].

PWM Interrupt
-------------
The PWM can generate a total of 10 types of interrupts, described as follows.

- Channel 0 ThresholdL Interrupt

  * This interrupt is generated when the PWM count value is equal to the value of the field pwm_ch0_threL in the pwm_mc0_ch0_thre register.

- Channel 0 ThresholdH Interrupt

  * This interrupt is generated when the PWM count value is equal to the value of the field pwm_ch0_threH in the pwm_mc0_ch0_thre register.

- Channel 1 ThresholdL Interrupt

  * This interrupt is generated when the PWM count value is equal to the value of field pwm_ch1_threL in the pwm_mc0_ch1_thre register.

- Channel 1 ThresholdH Interrupt

  * This interrupt is generated when the PWM count value is equal to the value of the field pwm_ch1_threH in the pwm_mc0_ch1_thre register.

- Channel 2 ThresholdL Interrupt

  * This interrupt is generated when the PWM count value is equal to the value of field pwm_ch2_threL in the pwm_mc0_ch2_thre register.

- Channel 2 Threshold ThresholdH Interrupt

  * This interrupt is generated when the PWM count value is equal to the value of the field pwm_ch2_threH in the pwm_mc0_ch2_thre register.

- Channel 3 ThresholdL Interrupt

  * This interrupt is generated when the PWM count value is equal to the value of the field pwm_ch3_threL in the pwm_mc0_ch3_thre register.

- Channel 3 ThresholdH Interrupt

  * This interrupt is generated when the PWM count value is equal to the value of the field pwm_ch3_threH in the pwm_mc0_ch3_thre register.

- End-of-cycle interrupt

  * This interrupt is generated when the PWM count value is equal to the value of field pwm_period in register pwm_mc0_period, indicating the end of a PWM cycle.

- Cycle Repeat Interrupt

  * This interrupt is generated when the number of PWM cycles reaches the value set in the field pwm_int_period_cnt in the register pwm_mc0_period. This interrupt can be used in stepper motor application scenarios, where setting pwm_int_period_cnt allows the stepper motor to generate an interrupt after rotating a specific angle.

- external brake Interrupt

  * A PWM interrupt will be generated when an external brake signal is generated.
  
ADC Linkage
----------
When the counter matches the threshold or the count value reaches the number of cycles, it will generate the signal that internally triggers ADC startup conversion. It should be noted that only PWM0 can trigger such conversion, while PWM1 cannot do that. The specific trigger source is set by the <pwm_adc_trg_src> bit in the register pwm_mcx_config0. This feature is commonly used in timing sampling. The following is an example.

Application scenario: In BLDC application, there is such a requirement that the current flowing through the coil shall be detected while the motor speed is controlled by PWM. In a PWM cycle, after PWM controls the power device to turn on, the current becomes stable after a certain period of time. Then, it is necessary to sample the current value, which means that there is a strict phase difference between the time point of triggering ADC conversion and PWM. For example, if the channel 0 of PWM is used to drive one of the phases of the motor, and a 10 KHz square wave with a duty ratio of 20% needs to be generated, and ADC sampling needs to be performed at the middle time point of the high level of the square wave, then the PWM cycle is 100us. When the clock source is 1 MHz, the cycle count value is 100, and the two thresholds of channel 1 can be set to 0 and 20 respectively. At this time, the counter is between 0 and 20, and PWM outputs a high level, and otherwise it outputs a low level. When the threshold L of channel 2 is set to 10 and the pwm_adc_trg_src in the register pwm_mc0_config0 is set to 4, pwm_ch2l_int can trigger ADC conversion. When the counter counts to 10, ADC will start sampling conversion at the middle time point of the high level generated by channel 1. This ensures that each sampling can meet the exact time requirement without CPU intervention, thus improving the performance.
