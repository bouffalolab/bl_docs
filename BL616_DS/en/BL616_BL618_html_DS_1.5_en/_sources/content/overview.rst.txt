Overview
==========
BL616/BL618 is Wi-Fi 6 + Bluetooth 5.3 + 802.15.4(Zigbee/Thread) combo chipset for ultra-low-power applications.

BL616/BL618 mainly includes two subsystems, wireless and microcontroller.

Wireless subsystem contains 2.4G radio, Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n/ax, BT/BLE, and 802.15.4 baseband/MAC designs. 

Microcontroller subsystem contains a low-power 32-bit RISC-V CPU with floating point units, DSP units, highspeed cache and memories. Power Management Unit controls low-power modes. Moreover, variety of 
security features are supported.

Peripheral interfaces include USB2.0, SDIO, Ethernet, SD/MMC, SPI, UART, I2C, I2S, PWM, GPDAC, GPADC, Audio, ACOMP and GPIOs.
Flexible GPIO configurations are supported. BL616 has total 19 GPIOs and BL618 has total 35 GPIOs.
